# A Simpler Approach

This repo contains both an implementation of an SDK which can be used to create document-centric RESTful CRUD systems following the 'A-simpler-approach' pattern, and a number of demos of the pattern in action.

## Directory Structure

- **`simpler-sor`**: ("Simpler System-of-Record") The source code for the SDK.
- **`demos/`**: Contains locally-runnable demos of the pattern in action. See the README in each demo for more information.
